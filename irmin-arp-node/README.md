This example unikernel brings up a stack with an [irmin-arp](https://github.com/yomimono/irmin-arp) ARP implementation (using the Irmin in-memory backend).  It then attempts to communicate with 192.168.3.2, which is expected to be running an echo server.  (Such an implementation is included [in the examples directory of mirage-tcpip](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/tree/master/examples).)
